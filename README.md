The goal of this project was to predict the hourly bicycle demand in the city of Chicago by using and comparing two machine learning models, Prophet and RandomForest. 
I cleaned up the data, visualized the rides per hour, and engineered features for RandomForest to use. For both models' performance, I made visualizations and calculated 
the root mean squared errors as well as the mean absolute errors to compare prediction accuracy.

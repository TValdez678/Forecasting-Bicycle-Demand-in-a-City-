The goal of this project was to predict the hourly bicycle demand in the city of Chicago by using and comparing two machine learning models, Prophet and RandomForest. 
I cleaned up the data, visualized the rides per hour, and engineered features for RandomForest to use. I made visualizations and calculated both the root mean squared error 
and mean absolute error for both models to compare prediction accuracy.
